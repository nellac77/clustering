Examples of a couple machine learning clustering models

## This repository contains the following two models used for clustering data:
+ K-Means Clustering
+ Hierarchical Clustering

Clustering is kind of like classification, with an important difference: in clustering, we are not aware of what we are looking for (unsupervised learning), so we try to understand segments of our data. The power behind clustering our data into these segments is that we may find unexpected structures, or groupings, that we had nt previously considered.
